# Implementation in Miscell

Miscell is my prototype language for doing spreadsheets (see here: https://github.com/owainkenwayucl/miscell)

To build the CSV spreadsheet from these files type `make`, with `miscellc` in your `$PATH`.

Once imported into LibreOffice Calc/Excel, you can set the value of n up to 65536 in cell D1 and pi will be recalculated accordingly.
