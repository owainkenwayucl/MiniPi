# Versions of the pi example for slightly less hospitable environments.

## Overview:

We maintain a repository of implementations of a particular method of 
approximating Pi here: https://github.com/UCL-RITS/pi_examples

This repository is for implementations that will not run on our standard Linux
host.  They may also lack "hard" things to implement on some platforms such as timing.

## Implementations:

* `ow-f77` - Open Watcom Fortran 77 on (Free)DOS.
* `BASIC` - Old fashioned BASIC such as S'-Basic/bwBASIC.
