# Versions of the pi example for slightly less hospitable environments.

## Overview:

We maintain a repository of implementations of a particular method of 
approximating Pi here: https://github.com/UCL-RITS/pi_examples

This repository is for implementations that will not run on our standard Linux
host.  They may also lack "hard" things to implement on some platforms such as timing.

## Implementations:

* `AppleScript` - Apple Script on MacOS 8.
* `BASIC` - Old fashioned BASIC such as S'-Basic/bwBASIC.
* `BBCMicroBitMicroPython` - uPython on the BBC Micro:Bit.
* `FORTRANIV` - FORTRAN IV on the PDP-8
* `LibreLogo` - LibreOffice has a built in LOGO interpreter.
* `MPW-3.4.2-C++` - C++ for MPW on MacOS 8.
* `MacPerl` - Perl for MacOS 8.
* `MacTk-8.2.1` - Tk/TCL 8.2.1 on MacOS 8.
* `Maclisp` - Maclisp on ITS on the PDP-10.
* `PORT-F77` - Cross Platform FORTRAN 77.
* `gambit2.4` - Gambit Scheme 2.4 on MacOS 8.
* `gambit3` - Gambit Scheme 3.0 on FreeDOS.
* `miscell` - My own terrible spreadsheet markup language.
* `ow-f77` - Open Watcom Fortran 77 on (Free)DOS.
* `sc` - Spreadsheet Calculator.
* `ulisp` - uLisp.
* `xlisp` - Xlisp on Mac System 7.
